      <header>Introduction</header>
      <p>Python is a versatile and popular high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It
        is widely used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation,
        and scientific computing.</p>
      <p>Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation, making it an
        ideal choice for beginners and experts alike. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural,
        object-oriented, and functional programming.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Prerequisites Section -->
    <section class="main-section" id="Prerequisites">
      <header>Prerequisites</header>
      <p>Before getting started with Python, you should have a basic understanding of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic understanding of programming concepts (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions).</li>
        <li>Familiarity with a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing Python code.</li>
        <li>Basic knowledge of how to use the command line or terminal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Python is beginner-friendly, so even if you're new to programming, you can start learning it with minimal
        prerequisites.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Variables Section -->
    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>In Python, variables are used to store data values. A variable is created the moment you assign a value to it.
        Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require you to declare a variable's type; it is
        dynamically typed.</p>
      <code>
          x = 10  # Integer<br>
          y = 3.14  # Float<br>
          name = "Python"  # String
        </code>
      <p>You can change the value of a variable at any time. Variables are just names that refer to objects in memory.
        Python uses dynamic typing, which means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Variables can hold different types of data (e.g., integers, floats, strings).</li>
        <li>Variable names should be descriptive and follow naming conventions (e.g., snake_case).</li>
        <li>Python is case-sensitive, so `name` and `Name` are considered different variables.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Conditional Statements Section -->
    <section class="main-section" id="Conditional_Statements">
      <header>Conditional Statements</header>
      <p>Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain code blocks based on a condition. The most common
        conditional statements are `if`, `elif`, and `else`.</p>
      <code>
          x = 10<br>
          if x > 5:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;print("x is greater than 5")<br>
        </code>
      <code>
          elif x == 5:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;print("x is equal to 5")<br>
        </code>
      <code>
          else:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;print("x is less than 5")
        </code>
      <ul>
        <li>`if` statement: Used to test a condition. If the condition is true, the code block inside the `if` statement
          is executed.</li>
        <li>`elif` statement: Short for "else if," this is used to check another condition if the previous one was
          false.</li>
        <li>`else` statement: Executes a block of code if none of the previous conditions are true.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Functions Section -->
    <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
      <header>Functions</header>
      <p>Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. You can define your own functions
        using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses.</p>
      <code>
          def greet(name):<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return f"Hello, {name}!"<br><br>
          print(greet("World"))  # Output: Hello, World!
        </code>
      <p>Functions help you organize your code into reusable pieces and make it more modular. They can accept arguments,
        return values, and be called multiple times from different parts of your program.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Functions are defined using the `def` keyword.</li>
        <li>Functions can accept parameters (inputs) and return values (outputs).</li>
        <li>Functions help make your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).</li>
      </ul>
